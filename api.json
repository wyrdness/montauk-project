      "full": "The Montauk Project refers to alleged secret US government experiments conducted at Montauk Air Force Station (Camp Hero) in Montauk, New York, during the 1970s and 1980s. According to the conspiracy theory, the experiments involved time travel, teleportation, mind control, contact with extraterrestrials, and kidnapping of youth for psychological experiments. The claims originated with Preston Nichols, who published a series of bestselling books beginning in 1992 based on what he claimed were \\\"recovered memories.\\\" Despite extensive investigation, **no credible evidence has been found** to support any of the claims, and the theory is widely considered **conspiracy fiction** by researchers and historians."

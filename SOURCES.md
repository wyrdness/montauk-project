## Research Notes

### Source Reliability Assessment

**Tier 1 (Reliable)**:
- Military historical records
- Air Force documentation
- New York State Parks records
- Scientific studies on memory

**Tier 2 (Moderate)**:
- Journalist investigations
- Skeptical analyses
- Local historical accounts

**Tier 3 (Low)**:
- Preston Nichols books (uncorroborated)
- Al Bielek testimony (unverified)
- Conspiracy theory websites

**Tier 4 (Unreliable)**:
- Anonymous internet claims
- "Recovered memory" accounts
- Unverified "leaked" documents

### Critical Evaluation

When researching Montauk Project:

✅ **Do**:
- Verify claims against military records
- Check source credibility
- Understand recovered memory problems
- Consider financial motives (book sales)
- Compare to documented real programs

❌ **Don't**:
- Accept testimony without corroboration
- Assume lack of evidence = cover-up
- Ignore scientific impossibilities
- Overlook timeline contradictions

### The Recovered Memory Era

**Context**: 1980s-1990s saw epidemic of false memories created through therapy:
- Satanic ritual abuse panic (largely false)
- Alien abduction memories (often therapy-induced)
- Past life regression (creating false memories)

**Montauk Project emerged in this context** — 1992, peak of recovered memory era.

**Scientific consensus now**: Recovered memories are unreliable, often false.

### Real Secret Program (MK-Ultra) vs. Alleged Program (Montauk)

| Aspect | MK-Ultra (Real) | Montauk (Alleged) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Documentation | Extensive (declassified) | None |
| Witnesses | Multiple, verified | Only Nichols circle |
| Physical evidence | Yes | None |
| Congressional investigation | Yes | No |
| Scientific plausibility | Yes | No |
| Current status | Confirmed real | Debunked |

**Lesson**: Real secret programs leave evidence trail, even when classified.
